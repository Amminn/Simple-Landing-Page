# Simple-Landing-Page From Figma to code

This is my practice on creating this Landing Page starting with HTML and then styling it with CSS

The design is coded pixel to pixel based on Figma design.

This design is responsive for phones and tablets and large screens, you can see live result [here](https://amminn.github.io/Simple-Landing-Page/).

And in the end watching how the instructore did it in [Scrimba](https://scrimba.com/).
